# You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

word1 = "abc"
word2 = "12345" # expected output "a1b2c3"

def merge_strings(str1, str2):
    # ?



    pass



merge_strings(word1, word2)
